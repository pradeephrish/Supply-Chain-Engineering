## Supply Chain Management Algorithms ##

This repository contains implementation of following algorithms.

1. Myopic
2. Lagrangian

[List may grow in future]

Every Folder contains single class file which has main method. 

Data can be given as two dimensional array.
Demand is represented by single dimensional array

    //example warehouse distance data
    Double[][] data = {
		    	{0.0,24.0,18.0,33.0},  //A
			    {24.0,0.0,25.0,12.0},  //B
			    {18.0,25.0,0.0,15.0},  //C
			    {33.0,12.0,15.0,0.0}   //D
	    };
	  
	//demand single dimensional array for  4 warehouses
	Double demand[] = {15.0,5.0,11.0,16.0};
